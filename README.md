Hi, I'm Joanna

I’m a career-changer transitioning into software engineering, combining a creative background with strong foundations in full-stack development and data handling.

- 🎓 Training: Code First Girls CFGdegree (Full-Stack Development) and Google Data Analytics Certificate
- 💻 Tech stack: JavaScript, SQL, REST APIs, web applications, data handling 
- 🧠 Focus: Problem-solving, clean code, clear reasoning, and building reliable features
- 🎬 Previous background: Creative arts and video production (project management and stakeholder communication)
- 🧩 Interests: Scuba diving, puzzles, console and board games (currently Turing Machine)

I’m keen to collaborate on beginner to intermediate projects, particularly those involving APIs, backend logic, or data-driven applications.
